    <h1>Add a new contract</h1>
    <p>An employee can have many contracts during working in the restaurant, but just only one contract is effective at one time. The column &quot;Had contract?&quot; in the Employee List shows if one employee has some contract or not. To add a new contract for an employee, you do as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the desired employee in the Employee List</li>
      <li>Click the <em><strong>New Contract</strong></em> button on the window</li>
      <li>Choose the position title of the employee</li>
      <li>Input the date when the contract is effective</li>
      <li>Choose the duration of the contract</li>
      <li>Click the button <em><strong>Save</strong></em></li>
    </ul>
