Welcome to Dream Restaurant - the perfect cuisine space!

Located on a crowded street, the restaurant has been famous with nice, airy and comfortable space since its inception. Dream Restaurant also has an impressive dining space. It is not separated into rooms. Instead, its spacious attic is wildly designed with the thatched roof and the columns of bamboo trees...

Accommodating over 500 guests, Dream Restaurant is ideal for birthday parties and company parties. It is also a perfect choice for couples who are looking for a space for their romantic wedding parties. At Dream Restaurant, you can always make a wedding party's reservation for 10 to 80 tables at the price of 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 VND / table (including beverages).

With the variety of services, Dream has specific menu for each season to satisfy even the most fastidious customers. Diners can gather round the hot pot with goat meat - which is the one-of-the-kind cuisine of the restaurant and enjoy a cool feeling of drinking beer. Both mountain's specialties and fresh seafood are collected and processed into a rich menu at our restaurant.

With the motto "Customers' satisfaction is the success of the restaurant", Dream Restaurant is honored and pleased to serve all customers!
