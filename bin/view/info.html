restaurant has been famous with nice, airy and comfortable space
since its inception. Dream Restaurant also has an impressive dining
space. It is not separated into rooms. Instead, its spacious attic is
wildly designed with the thatched roof and the columns of bamboo
trees...</P>

Accommodating over 500 guests, Dream Restaurant is ideal for birthday
parties and company parties. It is also a perfect choice for couples
who are looking for a space for their romantic wedding parties. At
Dream Restaurant, you can always make a wedding party’s reservation

seafood are collected and processed into a rich menu at our
restaurant.</P>
